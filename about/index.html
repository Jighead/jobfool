                <h2>Founded in 2006.</h2>
        We are fortunate to have the opportunity to significantly impact the lives of people and businesses each day. We are in the business of connecting job seekers with the right opportunities and employers with the best, most qualified candidates for their job openings. We facilitate this process through technology platforms such as job search, job distribution, and job boards, as well as through superior technology such as spidering / importing data, career resources, advertising, and job network communities.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Job Seekers</h2>
                <p>Searching for a job has never been more complicated. There are newspapers, generalist job boards like Monster.com, thousands of niche job boards, job aggregators, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Networking, and more! To complicate things, jobs are rarely posted in only one area and many of the most desirable jobs are posted to very specific job sites making them difficult to find.
        The Job Fool can help. We've aggregated jobs from thousands of sources and made them available from one centralized job site.<br><br><span class="red">No foolin around!</span> Now your job search can be simplified.</p>
                <br>
                 <h1>Employers / Recruiters</h1>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges of running a business is finding and hiring good employees. It's difficult to know where to turn when you have a job opening that you need to fill. We offer solutions that allow you to maximize your recruitment advertising efforts and services that help you research the best candidates, post your job to us as well as multiple job sites we network with.
        The Job Fool helps connect third-party recruiters to the best candidates. Through our partnership with JobTarget and their exclusive relationships with over 1000 specialty associations and organizations, we can access candidates that are not posting their resume into Monster or CareerBuilder. Our risk-free resume banks, sourcing technology, and job board technology are used by recruiters to get an edge.<br><br><span class="red">No foolin around!</span> The Job Fool can help!</p>
